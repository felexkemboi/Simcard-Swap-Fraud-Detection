# Sim Card Swap Fraud Detection.
With an upsurge in cybercrimes related to Sim Card Swap fraud in developing countries, making fraud detection is a top priority. If we are able to estimate whether someone is going to commit Sim Card Fraud we can surely try to prevent it earlier. 

## Intro
Predicting the likelihood of Sim Card Fraud Occurrence.
* **Analysis, Time series and prediction**
* **Train and test the data samples**
* **Normalize and summarize the data**

### Mode
Develop

### Implementations
* **1. Define Problem**
* **2. Prepare Data**
* **3. Evaluate Algorithms**
* **4. Improve Results**
* **5. Present Results**

### Usage
Sim Card Swap Fraud Detection.

### Model

* **Logistic Regression.** Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.


## Data
### Sample Dataset
There can be many factors as to why someone would want to swap his/her sim card, I will just use few. The swap will be represented by 1 and 0 will mean not swapped. I created this data for this exercise.
