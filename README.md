## Intro
Predicting the likelihood of Sim Card Fraud Occurrence.
* **Analysis, Time series and prediction**
* **Train and test the data samples**
* **Normalize and summarize the data**

### Prerequisites
Positive vibes.

### Mode
Develop

### Implementations

### Usage
Sim Card Swap Fraud Detection.
### Model

* **Logistic Regression.** Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.
